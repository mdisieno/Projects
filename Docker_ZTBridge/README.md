This will house a few simple modified Ubuntu Docker containers with various ZT configurations. These configurations will include:

1. A container with ZT/IPTables configurations to pass through ZT traffic to the local network.
   * This will be great for private local networks and those who want to access local assets remotely.

2. A container that ZT/IPTables configurations to pass any traffic directly through the ZT network to a master node.
   * Roll your own VPN for friends and family so that users can use ZT to connect. Affords the possibility to share a single VPN service amongst multiple users with my.zt admin.

ZT_NGRP - A container that routes all local nginx reverse proxy requests via NGINX Proxy Manager over ZT back to your home machine from a VPS.

* This will help those who have ISP's that block 80/443 ports due to "web hosting" regulations. This bypass will let you use a VPS and ZT as a means to reroute that traffic and create a front facing node in the network.
